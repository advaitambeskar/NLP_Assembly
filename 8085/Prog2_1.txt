Get the contents of memory location @2000H into accumulator 
Save the accumulator contents into B register 								
Get the contents of memory location @4000H into accumulator 
Store the contents of accumulator at address @2000H 
Get the accumulator contents back into A register 
Store the contents of accumulator at address @4000H
Terminate

output:
LDA 2000H
MOV B,A 					??what contents, it must be accumulator contents
LDA 4000H
STA 2000H
MOV A,B 					??what saved contents, it must be accumulator contents
