Initialize HL register pair as a pointer to memory location @2000H.
Initialize DE register pair as a pointer to memory location @4000H.
Get the contents of memory location @2000H into B register.
Get the contents of memory location @4000H into A register.
Store the contents of A register into memory location @2000H.
Copy the contents of B register into accumulator.
Store the contents of A register into memory location @4000H.	
Terminate program execution.
 
output:
LXI H 2000H
LXI D 4000H
MOV B, M
LDAX D
MOV M, A 					???it should be STAX H
LDAX B						???not MOV A, B
STAX D 						***STAX never takes memory location, it takes register pair
