HL points @4000H
Get first operand		???
HL points @4001H
Subtract second operand ???
HL points @4002H
Store result at @4002H
Terminate program execution

output:
LXI H, 4000H		check with 3rd line in ip and op  i.e. code should be semantically correct.
MOV A, M
INX H 				here we can use LXI again. this condition tells that our program must be semantically correct
SUB M
INX H
MOV M, A
